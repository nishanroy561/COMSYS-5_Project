## Project Structure
- **TASK_A**: Gender classification using ResNet-18
- **TASK_B**: Face recognition dataset analysis
- **Shared dependencies**: PyTorch, OpenCV, scikit-learn

## Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- Webcam (for real-time detection)
- 100MB+ disk space

## Architecture Overview

**TASK_A: Gender Classification**
- Uses a pre-trained ResNet-18 convolutional neural network as the backbone.
- Fine-tuned for binary classification (male/female).
- Input images are resized to 224x224 and normalized using ImageNet statistics.
- Faces are detected using OpenCV's Haar Cascade classifier before classification.
- A bias correction threshold is applied to improve prediction reliability.

**TASK_B: Dataset Analysis**
- Loads and analyzes PyTorch embedding files for the training set.
- Scans directory structures for both training and validation datasets.
- Computes statistics: number of people, images, embeddings, and overlap between train/val sets.
- Reports results and highlights any missing or mismatched data.
